# MySeniorProject

This code was used in my senior project, A Design and Development of Pharmacy Dispensing Machine for Outpatient, to develop GUI and code for use in the machine.
`GUI`

## Abstract

This project aims to design and develop of pharmacy dispensing machine to reduce one of the hospital service problems about mistake and time usage in dispensing trial. The machine has a basic mechanism from an automatic vending machine but this dispensing machine for outpatient solves the trouble about high cost, so this will be a good alternative for clinics and small hospitals.

This dispensing machine for outpatient is composed of 2 main mechanisms. The first composition is the body of the machine which is designed to be a rectangular shape made of aluminum profiles. This machine has 4 layers divided into 4 blocks which can contain 16 drug types. It drives the dosing from the servo motor and controls the dosing tray from the stepper motor. The second composition is the program using the raspberry pi4 model B to control the work of the whole program. The function of the program works by filling the type and number of drugs, then this machine will autonomously dispense the required drug.
